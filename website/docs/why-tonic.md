## Empowering Your Cloud Efficiency:


### Experience

Our founder **first** automated scheduling service for Amazon Web Services. Since 2013, the solutions has been in full production automating cloud solutions and saving companies on cloud costs and creating automated backups.


### Tønic does it all!

Avoid using separate services for starting and stopping your instances and creating backups. Tønic enables you to manage both tasks with a single service.

Offering actions for EC2, RDS, Redshift, S3, CloudFormation, and numerous other services, Tønic stands as the most comprehensive scheduling service available.


### Security
Tønic begins with no permissions to your AWS account, rather than imposing a broad, all-encompassing IAM policy that grants excessive permissions. We then construct a tailored IAM policy that includes only the necessary permissions for Skeddly to perform the tasks you require, and nothing beyond that.


### Experience
Tønic is renowned for its reliability, going beyond merely functioning as a single server with cron. Constructed from the ground up to ensure high availability and resilience, Skeddly guarantees that your actions will be executed on time.


### Our Customers Are Our Biggest Advocates
